https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MH3adDQ5yo,content itself is about to get a lot I'm telling you crazy [Music] [Music] what's the deal again welcome back to another YouTube video today is day 10 of the project dirty challenge the challenge where I upload 30 YouTube videos in 30 days today's video was supposed to be a sneaker on video I was going to show you guys all my sneakers and tally up how much the price of all my collection is but I actually had a surprise delivery today which changes the whole game plan last week when I gave you guys a tour of my office I actually excluded one particular piece in my office because I knew I'd be getting a shipment in to replace that piece this week I just didn't know it would come today but I'm excited to announce that I have a new partnership with Zeon Zeon is a tech company that actually specializes in gimbal products for all ranges of creativity and content creation from video and Film Production all the way to like your simple gimbals for your mobile phones and they actually sent me two of their best selling products to review so I have to say this again this video is actually sponsored by Zion is the Pioneer and number one brand in the gimbal market right now and as I mentioned beforehand they specialize in products for Professionals in film and the TV industry some independent Video Production Studios and general consumers who use gamble products so again huge shout out to Zeon for shooting me these two items but let's get right into unboxing to show you what they sent me [Music] the first product they sent me was the mileage G60 and I was actually in the market for a smaller more aesthetically pleasing Studio light just because the one I have in my office is just way too damn big it's it does light up my entire office but the downside to that is it's so big I can't even watch TV in here without having the light in the way so they call this the pocket cob light because it's so small it's Compact and it generates just as much light as your general Studio light it comes with a bunch of attachments like power cables a small stock box that you can attach to it that is really really perfect it comes with a mini tripod as well so this is actually perfect I cannot I'm actually gonna set this up on camera for you guys too so you guys can see the difference between the one I have set up and the newer light that I'll be switching to full time the G60 comes with two additional knobs on the back that allow you to adjust the strength of the light and the temperature so from cool to warm and that's dope because I can't even do that with the studio light I have in here now so this is huge just for downsizing and condensing my setup a little bit make it look a little bit more aesthetic a little a little bit more smaller you feel me and I'm excited to set this up but the second product is actually what I'm very interested in the second product they sent me is the true definition of efficiency when it comes to cob lights the models X100 runs at 249 dollars but let me tell you this is probably gonna be something I use every single day whether it be inside the house in the daytime or the night time but the malice X100 is a portable lightweight professional studio light that you can take on the go with you it comes with an additional battery pack that you can attach to the light it almost looks like you're holding a camera when you really hold it up in your hand this is something I'm going to be using all the time when I shoot my night scenes when I'm in the car or whether I want to shoot outdoors in the nighttime whether I want to do product photography professionally inside my office I can shut all the lights off and I have the access to move this light handheld wherever I want to go however I want to move it so this is actually going to be something I'm going to be using a lot more often but the malice X100 again is another version of their pocket cob light it's a little bit more pricey but again the efficiency on this is huge outside of the dope aspect of it being a handheld professional studio light it also comes with a built-in fan in the back so you don't got to worry about it overheating when you're using it for long hours of the day this is super sustainable I know as content creators or as videographers anybody who needs to use professional studio Lighting on the go having to deal with products that overheat is like is OD bro I know I hate my camera overheats sometimes so like to have that built-in fan in the back just to prevent it from overheating after like long usage is like it's pivotal but let me set these up real quick then I'm gonna show y'all how they work I'm gonna show you the difference between the modulus G60 and my studio video light then I'm gonna also show you guys how the handheld modus X100 works so let me as I'm excited usually tells let's get to it so this is what the studio looks like regularly with my softbox Limo Studio light again it's big it lights up the entire room now this is what it looks like with the new modus G60 like and it's a little bit darker in here but primarily the subject of the video is lightened it's a lot smaller a lot more condensed I'm actually going to adjust some settings when I get done with this video here but again this is huge again I'll go ahead and Link all the products down in my bio right now with a personal discount code you guys can use go ahead and get 10 off if you choose to pick up any of these products but this is the mollus G60 small pocket cob Studio light now let me get you the malice X100 cob light as well for the sake of the segment I turned the G60 off so you can see what it looks like where there's no Lighting in here now I have the pocket cob light let's see what this looks like on one percent this is crazy bro so like if I wanted oh Jesus Christ if I wanted to set this up somewhere I can set it up here I can set this up behind me I can put this on the side and get like a nice little cinematic kind of angle right here I can change the temperature on this as well just to give you guys like an example what it looks like to really really really warm if I really wanted to just to give me like another warm look but this is crazy bro this is great this is so crazy so that is it for day 10 of the project dirty challenge if you're interested in any of these products the links will be in the description below with again a special 10 discount code y'all can use to save some money but that is it I'll catch you guys tomorrow with a big big Vlog so y'all stay easy y'all stay Breezy I'm out of here tick tick,Zeon,Tech (Gimbal Products),Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript,Content Creation/YouTube,Not mentioned in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twN3-rgfnGc,not sure a few things and yes but before I tell you about them Elijah needs to tell you about our sponsor hey there you are but if you don't want to wait there's actually tons of videos online showing people building these speakers for themselves including this one guy who actually made it look like a little gun to point at a Target I don't know it's kind of cute just like this cute segue to our sponsor thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this episode what's really cool about this is everything we're about to show you courtesy of Intel who sponsored this video and sent over their new Emerald rapid Zeon CPUs life can suck sometimes but with the right attitude and tools you can fix it I'm talking about this poor laptop fix what you can this back to school season with our sponsor I fix it you may fail your tests but don't fail your laptop yeah it sounds about right but would you tell the people about our sponsor I fix it $100 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa no kid help okay let's do this thing I have a gift for you oh these Jaa special edition screwdrivers get rid of this one this one's gone look at these colors from our sponsor Jaa well I mean it's from us isn't it yeah we made it but we wouldn't have made it without their colors thanks Jawa it truly is very convenient of course as you know creating video costs money though so I can't tell your nephew anymore until we get through this message from our sponsor MSI as the old ones or as awesome as the segue to our sponsor back Blaze some of this it's good just like you can be the proud owner of this segue to our sponsor War Thunder and I'm sorry to tell you about our sponsor War Thunder so strong it makes me forget to to segue to our sponsor MSI just like nobody knows what on Earth would happen if I didn't segue to today's sponsor Squarespace one in front of us or behind us so many op to tell you about our sponsor G skill I'm going for it and I'm going for telling you about our sponsor oh one sec one sec dbrand has sent us a thing oh I'm settled and I'm settled on telling you about our sponsor gramarly I just hope I bought enough wood units to complete both our project and this segue to our sponsor see Sonic and thanks for watching and check out this message from our sponsor acronis lose a bunch of server equip well I might as well at least help pay for it with this message from our sponsor if I had time to untangle cables would my hair look like this why not switch to Magnetic cables from our sponsor mag tame instead now I say this is about the best outcome I could have possibly hoped for just like I couldn't hope for a better sponsor than our sponsor next to go free lunch which we're going to pay for with money from our sponsor who I'll tell you about after we do a couple of setups it's a good value like our sponsor rge enjoy your lunch Nolan very first one we reviewed and enjoy this segue I'll try to get you a new monitor to our sponsor rocket money is ryzen AI 300 enough to fend off the impending arm Invasion and can I fend off this invasion of Segways to our sponsor build Redux kind of like this awkward segue um to our sponsor acronis let me put it this way when seic heard we were going to attempt this they volunteered to sponsor the video as a demonstration of their confidence that nothing we show you today is going to harm their sales but before we do let's talk about what differentiates a quality PC power supply like this one from our sponsor seic wait where do I even start for this procedure oh too complicated thankfully our sponsor ODU is here to save my patient with their allinone platform for business Let Me O do something about this mess with our sponsor Odo I'm going to see if maybe I could have saved myself thousands of dollars and a heck of a lot of hassle I'm also going to see if I can tell you about our sponsor ug green and that I can sell and buy and upgrade over time to turn it into something truly exceptional like the segue to our sponsor origin PC just like I'm going to end up telling you about our sponsor I fix it I mean just look at the definition of this segue to today's sponsor see Sonic wo might finally start popping up in the premium consumer space just like this segue to our sponsor is popping up in my personal space delete me inventive like this totally original segue to our sponsor Ridge I was going to try to game on this some more but I think I'm done other than telling you about our sponsor Squarespace all you have to do is follow the link in the description to enter amd's been killing it both with continuing to sponsor this series that you guys all love and also giving you guys some pretty cool gear and I've got a gut feeling that we're going to talk a lot more about confusing branding after this confusing this segue confusing sponsor to our segue sponsor gkill to even see the screens we had in there there's no time to lose sponsor segue War Thunder other right I won and I love telling you about our sponsor War Thunder I need a word for what this thing feels like dumpy here listen for yourself and listen to the segue our sponsor next to go who's responsible and is there any justification for this business practice the only way to know is apparently to scan this barcode to our sponsor sorry little guy you're stuck like this with no hyperthreading like this non hyper segue to our sponsor delat me death song might be on to it even if uh you guys saw the title this ain't it Chief but this is a segue to our sponsor keeper do you all know something that I don't not for long you won't with the help of the labs team I will be F finding out if you made a big mistake or if everyone else is missing out on the best bang for the buck I know one thing you're all missing out on though our sponsor the ridge for a chance to win one of three AMD ryzen 7800 x3d gaming processors thanks again to AMD for sponsoring this series going to be surprised to learn exactly what they do and what they don't do for example none of them were capable of making this segue to our sponsor build Redux also not a replacement for our sponsor Micro Center what do you do once you run out of ports I mean hubs obviously but can we just keep plugging in Hub after Hub after Hub until we hit it what is it and what is the segue to our sponsor the ridge I think she canot take it anymore just like I can I take it anymore not telling you about our sponsor solid works let's,"Corsair, Intel, iFixit, Jawa, MSI, Backblaze, War Thunder,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKF5GtBIxpM,"my relationship with Plex has been Rocky it feels like they've changed hey uh can I watch a movie when I signed up for a lifetime license our future looked so bright but what happened I've been a loyal Plex user basically since I found out that air video didn't have an Android client and for the most part it's been great well at least it's worked mostly the truth is that increasingly I've been feeling like FX has lost its way I don't want games or live TV or yet another bloody movie rental service I want a management tool that organizes and streams my media library to my devices and while it does still do that mostly the community feedback on our recent sponsored video was the little push that I needed to finally check out the big competitor even internally around here jelly fin which is a free and open-source media management tool has received a lot of Praise but like any open source project you can count on three things some really good ideas and functionality that commercial products would do well to copy a rabid fan base that will turn any discussion of the paid alternative into an excuse to talk about it and some quirks that you'd have to have a blind spot the size of Jupiter to miss with that in mind then let's go swimming with the jellies and see what I've been missing out on and see our sponsor Zoho desk over a 100,000 business business worldwide trust Zoho context Weare help desk to improve productivity and ensure their customers are kept happy click the link below to learn more about Zoho desk one of the best things about plex is the Doom appeal whatever the device is be it a Samsung tisen TV PlayStation 5 VR headset or even a Facebook portal there's a first party app that will let you stream your own DVD and Blu-ray rips to it need more Shrek on your Android auto dashboard while you barrel down the highway well they've got an app for that to no sorry I'm just kidding about that one there is a Plex app for the car but it's Audio Only that's a key benefit of being a for-profit company as opposed to an open- source project you have the money to pay people to handle not just porting your applications over and testing them but also to deal with the tedium of getting them certified and listed on the various app stores I can't speak for our International audience but in Canada there are a total of 11 streaming apps available on the PS5 that aren't specifically for sports and Plex is the only one of them that's for selfhosted media and while jelly fin does also have an impressive lineup of official apps especially when they're free and open- Source Natures accounted for many of them are simply wrappers for web browsers that access the standard jellyfin web UI it is fine for most scenarios but as we'll discuss later confining developers to the limitations of a browser does have some downsides just try using jellyfin on the Xbox and it will become painfully clear that this method doesn't work well for every use case the jelly fin team does seem to be moving to address this issue though on iOS there are currently two official apps available jelly fin mobile which is the standard web browser implementation and the newly released Swift fin a proper native app that aims to be a standalone solution instead of piggybacking on top of safari for now all that one can do is basic Library browsing and Playback which barely scratches the surface of jelly Fin's capabilities but unlike its web browser cousin it finally works on Apple TV and could help to expand and jelly Fin's feature set in the future of course none of these apps matter if we don't have a server to get the content from in the first place thankfully neither Plex nor jelly fin are difficult to set up on a Windows desktop it's as easy as running an app and following the basic instructions all you really need is familiarity with file explorer so that you can point the server app at the correct folder or folders on Docker it is a touch trick here but it's not any more challenging than setting up any other Docker image the one curveball is you do need to choose between the Linux server image and the official image both are acceptable but the Linux server group just likes to change configurations a little bit compared to stock once the base installation is concluded the finer details of setup are all done through the web browser of any machine on the same network as the server the only scenario where there seems to be a big difference in server install methods is with FreeBSD Plex supports it jelly fin does not and traz core is based on FreeBSD so it's a bit of a bummer for users of what is arguably the best free Nas software setting up the library was as close to seamless as possible on either platform with only minor hiccups for a few titles on Plex for example our Shrek Blu-ray rips were not detected properly on dely fin though Thor Ragnarok was not detected properly it was slightly easier though to apply metadata on Plex as it gave us recommendations for what this unrecognized title could be while on Jelly fin we needed to use movie DB in order to set it subtitles were downloaded automatically by both though which is a huge Plus for accessibility DVD special features and extras on the other hand were not handled automatically on either system both times the files needed to be put in a specially named folder and have their metadata entered manually this would be a great area for both of them to improve though we're not quite sure if there's a good resource that already exists for cataloging the home release extras especially given how many of them are are and how different regions and even different releases of the same movie in the same region will often have different content speaking of content filtering on Jelly fin works pretty well on web and Android the UI is easy to follow with enough options to find most of what you want and all of them seem to just work multiple options can be selected both from different filters and from the same section on Google TV and Swift fin that's unfortunately not the case you have some sorting options but it's not really a replacement Plex content filtering on the other hand is much more robust but it lacks the ability to mix and match options options usually on Android you can mix and match away but don't try it on your TV in order to get to the filtering on either though you will first have to go into the section for the type of media you want then into the library tab from the default recommended tab jelly Fin's default view by contrast just feels less demanding the first thing you see is a row of your different Library types followed by a row of media you can continue to watch and then finally a list of the latest additions to your libraries no matter what you want you're clicking in roughly the same area and it doesn't require you to use multiple menus and click all around your screen just to filter through shows or movies parental controls in jellyfin are likewise pretty complete libraries can be restricted by account and maximum parental ratings can be set since we're in Canada the Canadian Motion Picture ratings are used but even when media has a rating from another system it seems to translate over pretty well a PG-13 rating for example will be read the same as a 14a rating Plex has a cool feature called managed accounts which allows you to set maximum ratings by selecting one of four restriction profiles younger kid older kid teen and none you're not able to customize however what these profiles restrict or create new ones which seems like kind of an oversight to me if you create a managed account you can actually share that with your friends and family but they won't have very much autonomy over it you can share your entire Plex library with their separate account that they control though turning your Blu-ray collection into a sort of Legally problematic private Netflix in order to use all the features though they will need a Plex pass of their own jelly Fin's only option for accounts is to create one manually for each person not unlike a Plex managed account which isn't a problem but they won't be able to select their own username or recover their account if they lose their password so if you enjoy resetting great an Janine's sixlet password every 3 weeks so she can watch her stories uh you'll have a great time with that how about the actual video players though as it turns out these vary a fair bit between platforms on web Plex allows you to do quite a bit like changing the subtitle Styles access accessing the play C adding a video to a playlist downloading the file and granting Library access to others the only things jelly fin does that Plex doesn't do out of the box is show you what time it will be when the video ends that's kind of cool while they can both skip intros they both use the same flawed method of detecting intros audio gets compared between episodes and sections that match are flagged as long as they adhere to a rule set as a solution it's far from perfect especially for shows with opening gags and variations such as how Lisa's saxophone riff changes slightly between episodes a better solution might be to allow a mixture of this and scene recognition with the ability to tweak it between shows Plex does not detect intros for example that are less than 20 seconds long and can only find them in the first half of an episode jelly fins intros skip on the other hand is a plugin that needs to be installed which isn't convenient but the payoff is that it is much more customizable that customization comes at a cost though as the only way to implement the skip intro button is with the web UI for those browser wrapper apps like the jelly fin player on iOS that works fine but for the native apps like Swift fin on iOS and Apple tv there is no way to pop up that skip intro button on Google TV both uis are similar to pretty much any other video streaming app uh Plex lets you toggle subtitles playlists and playback quality the usual um oh and it also has an added bonus sometimes when you switch playback quality on a TV show just after the credits finish it'll act like the episode has completed kicking you to the up next screen and then it'll autoplay the next episode at original quality which is this this is intended functionality right man I've seen a lot of bugs on Plex uh jelly fin on Google TV while looking similar enough actually has a surprising amount of options for customization you can change the entire layout of the home screen the functionality of buttons on your remote and because it's a native app you can even change what underlying video player is being used though again this means that plugins that rely on modifying the web version like skip intro simply will not work on standard phone and tablet Android we see the biggest difference so far between the uis functionally they're not that different from their Google TV counterparts aside from one key detail the ability to download one of plex's biggest selling features is offline mobile access they know it and you will too if you try to use a free account got to love that upsell the idea and this came along long before YouTube and Netflix offered similar functionality is that you can download your videos at whatever resolution and bit rate you like and then watch them on the plane or wherever else you happen to be then when you come back online any episodes or movies that you watched will be marked as such in your library man that would be a cool feature to have wouldn't it yeah of course it would be which is why I get so angry about this plex's mobile downloads feature is buggy at best and non-functional to the point of false advertising at worst on Android downloads might work fine for you mostly so long as you want the original quality but half a gig or more per 20-minute episode is going to eat up your storage very quickly if you're working with web downloads and just two full fat Blu-rays could completely fill up an entry-level phone but then that's the whole point of having a server to transcode the files in the first place right unfortunately downloading transcoded videos is where the trouble really happens the fact that the download fails is enough to get frustrated over like no you retry this you know it failed you know it has to be retried why do you need me to come back to my phone constantly and click the button but it's even worse than that Plex will sometimes show that a download has completed even though it never downloaded anything now this problem can be made worse by not using Hardware transcoding but it can be very challenging to figure out if Hardware transcoding is working or even if it is working which GPU it's running on I mean imagine taking a long road trip with a backseat full of kids you've spent valuable packing time in the evening before loading up all the entertainment trusting Plex when it tells you hey I got got you half an hour into the drive all hell breaks loose and it's become painfully clear you've been lied to it's enough to make you wish you had a vehicle with a separate back seat bubble Dome complete with optional restraints and muzzles to contain your quarreling children which is a reference they might get if the shows I tried to download for them had worked on iOS things aren't much better often the app will just crash for me when I'm trying to download and even when it doesn't it might just not work anyway if you're using a firewall with DNS rebinding or knat reflection there's a very good chance that the security certificate that Plex attaches will get the transfer blocked and this has been a known issue ever since Plex switched their mobile SYNC feature for mobile downloads back in mid 2021 you heard me right Plex has had more than a full year to fix a major selling feature that they advertise and still haven't done so but thank God I have games and it's not the first time that they've pulled this mobile photo backup to your server was an awesome alternative to paid cloud services that just quietly went away fine I got over that one but downloading my media for offline viewing is a make or break feature for me I care so much about it that when I realized it had stopped working which was on a recent trip I didn't really travel for a couple years and didn't really notice I dropped Plex as a sponsor we're not going to work with Plex until they resolve some of my longtime issues with it however it's also the same reason that I am not going to be switching over to jelly fin yet for now jelly fin only offers bog standard download the original file offline viewing and has no way of keeping track of what has or hasn't been viewed this way thankfully though the road map going forward looks very promising at least on paper the move to Native apps means that offline playback is a very real thing that's coming up because it doesn't require downloading a web page for the UI and it can use the systems built-in video player unofficial apps like F Droid already allow you to watch shows offline and can even update episodes once viewed unfortunately it lacks the option to download a transcoded version meaning that it's pretty rough on your storage but it is an implementation nonetheless and that means that the jelly fin core team has something to iterate on offline viewing is the top post on Jelly Fin's feature request board and they have said they're working on it even if there is no ETA yet similarly native intros skipping is the fourth most requested feature though for that one there's no word on whether anyone is actively working on it given that there's already open source implementations for these features in some capacity hope hopefully they can use the work that's already been done to cut down on development time but being free and open source slow development Cycles are to be expected and we should just be grateful for everything that they do do jelly Fin's biggest contributors still have day jobs after all making it all the more impressive then when they Leap Frog Plex and functionality like their configurable HDR tone mapping I mean it's frustrating that the paid solution is so buggy and incomplete and that the Free Solution is so slow in development I mean if we could just put plex's money into jelly fin maybe we'd have a good solution but then because capitalism ruins everything we'd probably start the cycle all over again probably that leads us pretty well then into the elephant in the room MB is the formerly open- source project that jelly fin is based on and apparently already has several of the features that Plex claims to have and that jelly fin claims to be working on its user base though is significantly smaller to the point where I'm kind of hesitant to put the time into switching over and it also doesn't help that there's no effective way to try it before you buy it but given that there's seemingly no other matured Alternatives could it be worth giving a shot I would love to know your experiences positive or negative with MB sell me on it or talk me out of it as for my final message to the Plex Team guys you haven't lost me yet but you have got to get it together basic functionality here like this crappy copy of Hercules that I have that won't play back audio at original quality but will if I transcode [Music] like which by the way when I transcode half the time it reduces the audio volume and not to mention your inability to play the next episode for me on mobile stuff like that cannot be broken but if you can deal with my list here I will happily take you back as a sponsor in the meantime let me tell you about someone who isn't on my sponsor poop list secret lab their chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7VRGh_5Krw,it feels like just yesterday we launched our initial sponsorship program on techlore but it was actually way back in November 2021. coming up on two years later I'm excited to announce our brand new sponsorship program to keep techlore expanding to the world you might be asking why sponsors Henry well I have been fairly vocal regarding my criticisms of crowdfunding things like patreon not because I don't think it's a fantastic model that's about as pure and intimate as it gets and one that we actually need but because not enough people partake in it we receive hundreds of thousands of views a month on YouTube with over 200 000 subscribers and yet we currently have under 200 people on patreon and there isn't a lack of exposure these patrons are showcased in our descriptions at the end of nearly every video in pinned comments and in other areas like our website's homepage I don't think there's any more convincing that can be done nor should I need to you all have every right to decide where you spend your money and to our current patrons I'm forever grateful for the amount of support you give us you actively enable us to independently do what we do even with sponsors it's your independent support that allows us to say no to sponsors literally and every day a little Wikipedia fact I'm making fun of Wikipedia's things that they do but if just one percent of all our YouTube viewers last month contributed just one dollar to Techwood one percent of everyone just donated a dollar we would have made five times the amount of money we currently make on patreon just to give you guys some perspective so while crowdfunding is massively important I don't think it can be a significant Revenue source and this seems to be a common theme with other creators as well this isn't just an issue with us here at teclar money is important not just because we're real people who pay for rent in groceries and need to live somehow but because teclar is something I want to continue to expand to do this we need money for production equipment devices to keep up with demanding workflows devices to perform reviews hosting for all our various projects and the numerous other expenses incurred on a monthly basis sponsors can directly right now and will continue to push us to new limits allowing us to spread privacy and security to audiences never seen before all alongside our patrons now you might be asking well you already had a sponsorship program so what changed what went wrong and yeah all good questions so some of you may have noticed earlier this year we actually ceased video sponsor segments you might have not seen one of those one minute segments in a long time this came down to a few issues first producing dedicated sponsor segments added time to our production workflow especially since multiple production steps required coordinating with each individual sponsor we had to delay numerous videos just in the name of making sure the sponsor segment was done properly and to everyone's standards which includes our own standards our audience's standards you guys and our sponsor standards so it did make our content harder to produce second we universally fell behind on many things sponsors aside we were already struggling with too much work and not enough time to do it I felt it was more important to prioritize getting caught up which required pausing our sponsorship program until we were back on our feet third I personally felt our sponsor format of one minute video segment made our content feel less genuine and this really hit me when I watched a Linus Tech tips video for the first time in like years and I was like wow this is like just heavily commercialized and it feels really non-genuine build Redux taking what I learned from that whole previous program I'm thrilled to announce our new sponsorship program is here our new program is very exciting as it's more diverse versatile and simpler for everyone involved previously we only offered those one minute sponsored video segments we're dropping those I didn't like them I don't think I want to keep doing them and instead we're offering multiple sponsorship offerings for our videos which are now featured in the outro through video and or audio we're also adding sponsors to our spa quiz security privacy and anonymity quiz which is on our website you'll be featured before the quiz and after finishing there's also an option to have product placements within our videos now this will need to be careful with because we feature services and things organically within our videos like like for example we featured crypty in our lockdown video so I had to think of how to do this in a way where all of you would know something was product placement and I just had to make the flat out rule that no tech companies were allowed for product placements only there's also the very rare we've only ever done one of these dedicated sponsored video showcases so we did this cake pay video not too long ago and the reason why I took this one was because I felt that it was actually something that I could do in a way that was honest that was new that was fresh and it was something that was actually valuable to our audience I was showcasing a service that I think a lot of people didn't even know existed that allowed them to buy things out in public privately without any personal information really so it was a very unique offering and if we ever stumble on those again then I'm not against it but I think this one's going to stay pretty rare we get offers almost every day from companies to sponsor things and as of today we've only accepted four companies for sponsors so this is actually pretty rare and this one's even more rare so these new sponsor options vary in medium in audience commitment price point and creativity we have a whole sponsor guide for people interested in applying for those sponsorships and as always all sponsors have to respect our strict protocols which you can also all view down below and help hold us to it speaking of I also developed review unit protocols as some people rightfully brought up some concerns about how a review unit could be a possible influencer conflict of interest for a review that we perform I will say while a review unit has yet to influence our content I wanted to at least put in protocols to keep it that way and let you all have something to hold us to as well all right now that that's all out of the way you might be asking what does this mean for me and well it doesn't seem like it really impacts you but it does if you're a viewer rest assured our content and resources will remain independent our Protocols are thorough and no sponsor is ever worth our reputation and this is why our patrons exist so that we have enough to get by so we you don't have to depend on sponsors if you're developing Services rest assured we are still no more likely to recommend you over anyone else because of a sponsorship our resources have their own dedicated criteria ensuring we remain independent most importantly what this means for everyone is you're going to see more techler content better quality tegular content better performing techler content and finally more projects and initiatives we've never been able to start or finish due to time and or financial limitations we work on a ton of things back here and so having the finances and freedom to be able to pursue them independently is massively important in finishing those up now I did want to say some thank yous because we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for some very special people I wanted to thank all of our original sponsors cake wallet localmonero privacy.com and abein delete me who all believed in our mission and gave us a shot in showcasing their brands we wouldn't have gotten this far without them nor would we have been able to put together the new protocols without them I want to thank everyone who I talked to behind the scenes for advice forming these new protocols you all know who you are you all massively helped me put this together so thank you I want to thank each and every one of you our viewers who welcomed our introduction to sponsors in 2021 with open but still wary arms you all stayed skeptical but still gave us a shot to prove to you that we could do sponsorships in an ethical way that wouldn't compromise on our quality and reputation so if you didn't give us that shot we would have never had the confidence to actually go forward with accepting sponsors I also especially probably the biggest thank you I have to give is to our patrons and our direct Financial supporters who allow us to have such strict protocols in place it's you all who allow us to not be completely dependent on sponsors so we can still have the freedom to tell sponsors know and turn them away every day if they're unable to respect our protocols which is what we do and that's kind of it if you're interested in sponsoring our content check out our sponsorship guide down below if you're someone who likes what we do and wants to contribute what we do we still need your support over on patreon and other places we still value that because we never want to be completely dependent on sponsors if you have any feedback or anything you want to share or any questions leave it down below I also have a blog post covering all this and there's also a announcement made on our Forum as well so there's lots of different places where you can go ahead and see more information everything has been designed so that you can verify what we do and you don't have to put blind faith in us so that's the goal here I hope you guys have a great day and we'll see you next time on Tech lore I'm excited to see where this goes woohoo,None,N/A,Techlore,Technology (Privacy and Security focused),N/A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mSspQaR5k0,have you ever wondered what kinds of scams weird emails and just playing out viruses we get as tech reviewers in our email inboxes well i think today i better show you so every year i make a video like this so might as well make another just to start off i have not done any paid advertisements and this is clearly a scam do not think that i could make this much money off of a video uh for a pre-roll out of 60 seconds otherwise you'd see a lot of 60-second ads and i would not be in school still so just so that's out of the way let's get started on just taking a look at this so when i get an email like this uh the red bar wasn't here originally this has since come up recently uh but yeah no we are interested in advertising your youtube channel okay that's fine um we like the creativity on your channel oh that's my favorite thing people the people that email you say that they love your channel have been watching for forever they haven't they just want you to advertise their product that's fine um in the future if you agree to our cooperation you'll have a commercial for our video editing application uh pre-roll about 50 to 60 seconds uh after the publication of the promotional video on your channel you will immediately receive a money transfer now this is the equivalent of like the nigerian prince wanting to send you his inheritance it's not only is this an absorbent amount of money yeah maybe 10 times what i'd expect for an advertisement of this kind and i clearly clearly do not think this is a thing so a couple other things um i just want to point out first off the if you're gonna send a professional email to someone that you want them to take seriously do you just spam advertising in the title bar uh no no the worst part is they've just copied and pasted this email a couple times and honestly if you look into this more it tells you kind of like who they've emailed if you're one of the email youtubers that got one of these emails i highly discourage working with this company and then they've given you a price that is way too good to be true and the formatting uh is also interesting now when you look up this company gnog.corp i'm assuming that's the name of this uh you don't get anything google says i have no idea what you're talking about which usually is an even better sign so if you're someone watching this a company that's wanting to make me review something or something like that um have a registered company now another thing i love getting emails about is asking to review products that require you have another product that i don't have so if you take a look at my channel right here you can take a look i have some computers that i've been building over the course last couple years from pretty much yard sale parts stuff out of the garbage and maybe paying a couple hundred dollars here or there in total i think i spent about 500 on all these parts which i know makes some people really jealous i understand but to keep in mind that's where i spend my money that's why i choose to spend my money um but i don't have the only apple device i currently own is my iphone and that's because i i got circuit into the ecosystem do i like apple not particularly so when i have an email about a company wanting me to review an ipad not only do i not have an ipad nobody in my household does which presents an interesting circumstance if i wanted to review this oh yes i don't have the product that this goes with but i think it's a great product i mean a backlit keyboard is nice i like the backlit keyboard on this sucker it's very nice but i that's just people that ask you review stuff it's not like i have ever reviewed an apple product ever on this channel i have never reviewed an apple product on this channel so like why would i have an apple product and then here's the other category that these emails tend to fall into what you're doing is you're basically saying oh yes i'm going to advertise your stuff and go on the assumption you're going to pay me now if this first off macy's which last time i checked was like a clothing store i haven't been to macy's in a bit but then i haven't been to any store in a bit macy's is like a clothing store right a general purpose kind of more focused on clothing um why would a tech channel have anything to do with clothing i mean you should look at some of my past videos i barely have a t-shirt on like clothing is not the word that would come to mind when i think of a computer hardware channel let alone jay's tech vault so i find this very interesting that they want you to earn a five percent commission from your sales i recommend this shirt guys it's a nice sweater um it's unbranded and so i got a sponsorship email from a company called honey which if you're familiar with anything on youtube they're a pretty reputable company that a lot of big youtubers do stuff with i'm not going to advertise them but they are clearly a decent company and i as i said have a reputation that precedes them when i get an email from honey quote quotation marks um they say you know we'd like to do a sponsorship um and when you look at this there's a couple things that i think really really send the red flags off um first off you see that wanting 500 for a 45 second integration in your video now that's fine that's a lot of money for what anything i've gotten offered before i'm looking at like 150 dollars for a really good banger video that the company wants so i choose not to do that because i personally think that degrades the user experience for you guys and i really have to weigh the option of could that money go towards something that i could make this channel better with or would it more harm the video and therefore the channel and not really be any benefit and i haven't really come up with anything that i could use that money for that would directly help the channel i mean i bought a tripod but that was from ad revenue so i think really the question to ask here is when you look at this first that looks okay i mean it looks like a lot of money something you'd want to pursue so i said uh you know hey thanks for contacting me but i noticed a little something um honeybusinessofficial.gmail.com when you go to honey that's not actually any of their emails yeah so they have the domain joinhoney.com now when you go to look at any of their emails it's like support joinhoney.com or you know press joinhoney.com why would they not use the same email for the email that they contact all the reviewers with or all the people they want to do sponsorships with plus this link not only is this the quote unquote the actual ceo of honey i i highly doubt that how many people work at honey so just so we're clear honey has approximately 500 to 1 000 employees according to glassdoor.com so when i see an email from not only the owner like the ceo of honey who's at like a 500 person company that's not happening there's like a press manager for sure you have they want you to click on a weird link and they are offering you absorbent amounts of money on a email that's not official i say you have some red flags so i even bothered emailing them and i said you know what kind of uh verification are you looking for and i said uh you know i said i called him out i said at least you you should have a domain that emails me that at least is official and that's been eight days ago and i haven't gotten a response so windows key resellers and their own are pretty okay i've bought some keys in the past um but there's a lot of issues that come up when you talk about windows keys first off a lot of companies a lot of these companies that are emailing me don't have really good reputations their keys don't work and they're buying them from different geo locations like asia for example and reselling in the united states which is against microsoft's terms and a lot of people have had their keys just reset so when you look into windows key resellers they turn out to be a very shady organization and therefore when you look into this you're like i really really can't get behind supporting that and i really can't advertise it all together i actually have a video that i never published that was pretty much a 10-minute rant about how key resellers are very shady and i would be very careful with doing business with them because it makes me wonder how these companies have in the past i've gotten offers for like 200 and i've had like maybe one email me every week and a different one so where are these companies getting all the money that they can advertise these keys when they're selling windows keys supposedly at market price in like asia here that really makes me wonder especially because it seems very shady and that's why i refuse to do anything with them as well um and then here's a company that is probably not actually bad at all um i just think that likely this company is trying to get me to review a desk lamp now what i find very interesting is i have a few lamps i mean if you look at my older videos on this channel you will certainly see that the light is the something that didn't exist for a while on this channel and i've since gotten some lights to at least big as you can see me but i i think that lamps don't really qualify under tech uh and then perhaps i have multiple emails in my inbox wanting me to review pillows i have uh something that comes to mind when i think of pillows is uh not tech and then guys if it doesn't get any better why not send you a toilet bowl cleaner like did you just take a trip to taco bell did you eat sugar-free gummy bears well let me introduce you to the uh toilet cleaner because that's totally what a tech channel should be reviewing like what would i even review this as like hi guys i i don't even know if i can make that video like i don't think it would be the most funniest video hello guys today we're reviewing a toilet bowl cleaner did you take a trip to taco bell and did it make it well good lord here's another pillow that was almost a year ago holy crap never responded that one we are a profession we are a professional amazon seller we notice that you write product reviews on amazon and care about you for a long time now that's a lie it proves that you are a brilliant reviewer and an excellent evaluator our company recently developed a new pillow filled with small pieces of shredded memory foam which can promise you a wonderful sleep we now we are looking for reviewers to test it if you're interested in reviews please contact we'll send you more information it is our pleasure to have your sincere review so guys it's winter and i think you need some clothing so today we're going to ask you to review a bunch of clothing now me guys for me i i clearly have lots of experience with kids winter mittens and i'm going to make my video about kids winter mittens because i certainly would fit into them and i certainly have kids so gosh this is like what what what do these people think like they're like oh yes i have gone through your uh information amazon's top reviewer list and consider you to be a reliable objective and experienced shopper and reviewer including i haven't bought anything on the account like this is through the amazon affiliate like program and corrupt i haven't bought anything on that account i use my parents because they got prime so like [Music] and the worst part is we are a professional and dynamic team focused on winter products who are tests look for who are finding tester for our products we sincerely invite you to try our product and share your reviews on amazon you will get a product free and an extra five to twenty dollars for your join on paypal the following content we show you our products is there any products you're interested in if yes please reply through what the way you'd like and we'll show you details about the product if you have any idea of cooperation let us know i am pretty sure paying somebody for review which here i'm gonna give you this product review and i'm gonna slip you an extra twenty dollars and plus this is a channel that they clearly don't know like they clearly don't know anything about me this is like what gets me the most frustrated people just send you crap and then expect you to review it and now chief,"gnog.corp (potentially, but deemed suspicious)",Video editing application (purported),Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript,Tech Review/Computer Building,None
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvgICWi3xNQ,"The 8 gigabyte 5060 Ti finally gets benchmarked. Google's ad company is a monopoly and the 9070 GRE looking mighty fine. Let's get into the hot news, everybody. I'm your Brett host. We're going to be going over the hottest tech news I can find on the internet while you enjoy your breakfast this Friday, April 18th, 2025. Going to start off by mentioning that we're giving away this Sapphire Nitro Plus over on our brand new uft music YouTube stream that we got going on over on that channel. Well, you can go check out that live stream in order to find out the details on how to win the Nitro Plus, which in my opinion is the best looking 9070 XT out there, and we're going to have that featured in a video that's going live sometime soon. But what we're not going to have in a video anytime soon is the RTX 5060 Ti. We don't have one. Can't buy one. Nobody's sending us one for review. So, the best I can do is talk about a Chinese creator over on BillyBilly who got the first RTX 5060Ti 8 GB GPU reviewed. And it turns out that the VRAM, at least according to this review, doesn't make much of a difference at all. 8 GB appears to be totally fine in the vast majority of their testing. You look at like Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p, they perform roughly identically in the average as well as the 1% and.1% lows. And then also the exact same situation when it comes to 1440p. Now, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows for the 8 GB card. There are some where it falls behind just ever so slightly. So, we're talking at 1080p, the 5060 Ti 8 gig is 16% faster than the 4060 Ti 8 gig. And then the 16 gig model is 19% faster. So, we're talking just a few FPS here at 1440p. The 8 gig 5060 Ti 17% faster, while the 16 gig pushes a little bit higher, coming in at 21% faster, but again, just a modest amount. And it's not really going to happen in all games. If you go through the Billy Billy video, the vast majority of games, they're exactly tied. And there's even some instances where the 8 gig beats it out. Now, there is some interesting uh if not weird data when it comes to DLSS4 and multi-frame gen. The testing shows that the 8 gig falls behind when it comes to generating fake frames, but it appears like that might be a bug rather than an example where the 8 gig actually falls behind. Very strange situation. What's also strange is this Gigabyte graphics card. I want to talk about this simply because I don't think I've seen a card that that's this small on this high end of a GPU before. Normally you find them on like a a 50 class card, whereas the 60Ti gigabyte card, look at how small that PCB is. It's only an eight lane GPU. And so they made it just eight lanes big. You got basically no room for very much in there. And even the power connector is towards the front rather than towards the back. It's a strange setup. and most of it's just like back plate and fans. We're GPU. But speaking of fans, and speaking of a PC that you might have, you should definitely check out today's video sponsor. As a pioneer and advocate of positive pressure designing cases since 2008, Silverstone knows the importance of good filtration to a PC, and they know how to sponsor this video. If you didn't know already, keeping dust out of your PC requires calculated design to ensure good positive pressure air flow and correct placement of filters in cases. So, in addition to making awesome cases, Silverstone is an expert PC filter maker. For 2025, Silverstone has launched their FF126. This set of four 120 mm size filters are quite special with both the frame and the mesh being made of stainless steel. It's common to see a steel frame or mesh, but not both. This allows the Silverstone FF-126 to be extremely durable, even likely to outlast nearly any other component in your PC, all while protecting them from dust and tiny debris. Grab yourself this impressive filter set from Silverstone via the link below. Thanks to Silverstone for sponsoring today's video. While you might not need to use one of those fan filters on a handheld while you're on the go, it looks like AMD is filtering out performance when it comes to the new Ryzen Z2A APU that's supposed to be launching alongside things like the Z2 Extreme, the Z2G, and the Z2. The latest reports on the Z2A indicate that it's actually going to be pretty far behind being a Vang APU coming in with only four Zen 2 cores and eight RDNA2 compute units. So very far behind what we've seen with the Z1 or Z1 Extreme in terms of generations on CPUs and then also generations behind when it comes to the actual compute units and gaming performance. This is apparently going to be for very budget gaming handhelds that might be coming out moving forward. I just really hope that the price point makes sense like 199 Switch Light situation rather than what we had with the RG Ally where you like you were paying 400 bucks for the Z1 when it sucked. And a lot of people think RA tracing sucks which is all well and good. You're entitled to your opinion, but Nvidia wants to convince you otherwise with their 108 GB Zora demo, which is a comprehensive showcase of Unreal Engine 5 and path tracing using essentially everything that you could imagine. They have released this where you can download this onto your own computer and watch your PC cry trying to get all of this rendered on your RTX 3070. In case you want to upgrade to something that's a bit more worthwhile, like a 9070 XT that can rate trace a little better, maybe Reese can save you some money so that you can uh get closer to affording one of these. Yo, welcome back to Deals. Bring the hottest tech deals out on the internet. Happy Friday everyone. Hope you guys have a good weekend planned ahead and I'll send you off into the weekend with some deals. Starting off today, we have the Cooler Master Elite 301 Light MicroATX case, which you can get for only $39.99 with included coupon making it $15 off. But then next up, we have this Monsek M1WV3 HE wireless gasket mount hall effect keyboard available in this super sick purple color for only $9749, making it $32.50 off. And then lastly, we have the Intel Core i5 13600 KF desktop processor for only $149.99, making it $50 off the total price. And hey, with that, the deals are done. You can find these and more linked in the video description down below. But until next time, I'm going to hand you your back to bread for the rest of your heart news. Cheers. Well, Ree, it turns out that the US Department of Justice thinks that Google's had way too good of a deal when it comes to its advertising business over the last few years. A federal judge has now ruled that Google is indeed monopolistic when it comes to their online advertising portion of their business and explicitly saying that they've engaged in a series of anti-competitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher, ad server, and ad exchange markets for open web display advertising. and that Google tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange together establishes and protects its monopoly power in these two markets. So the idea here is that obviously Google is going to appeal this because they do not agree with this assessment whatsoever. But the Department of Justice is indicating that Google may have to divest some of this on top of already having to potentially divest their Chrome asset from their company just because of the monopoly that's going on there. Obviously, this is a ruling that's happening. Who knows how this is going to play out later on down the line, whether or not the appeal is going to go through. We don't know exactly where this is going to end up. This is just the initial ruling and there's probably going to be a lengthy court battle that's going to happen moving forward. But Google uh having to fight the fight in the courts on everything that's going on. And Apple has had to fight the fight on convincing anybody that the Apple Vision Pro is actually good to use besides YouTubers who want to make it for videos. And that's why we're getting reports of the Apple Vision Air. We got details coming out about how it's going to use titanium in order to get slightly lighter components as well as be dark blue or somewhat of a midnight exterior. So, this is going to be slightly different in color. There's been a leaked version of the power connector, which is kind of their midnight color. It's a very, very dark blue. But, one of the things to note about this power connector is that it actually is capable of delivering less power with only eight pins as opposed to the 12 pins that goes on the Vision Pro. But we don't know a whole lot about the Vision Air just yet in terms of its performance level. There's been some rumors that it's going to have an A series chips like what you find in the iPhone as opposed to an M series chip, which is what's currently in the Vision Pro. And also, we don't really know about the price point, what that's going to look like. There's been some speculation that should be roughly $2,000, but again, that's just uh ballparking that I've seen. Not Not necessarily uh an actual indication. Maybe it's going to be more expensive than that. And also, there's no ETA on when this thing's supposed to come out. The Vision Pro has now been out for roughly a year and a couple months. It could be time for the Vision Air to launch, maybe sometime later this year, about 18 months after the launch of the Vision Pro. We'll have to see how that all shakes out. And AMD is shaking out their GPU lineup. We're getting specs being revealed of the 9070 GRE. We know that the 960 XT is supposed to be dropping, but the 970 GRE looks to be a pretty compelling option, unless you happen to be one of those VRAM fanatics who wants 16 GB. The 9070 GRE appears to have 75% of the total cores of the 9070 XT and it has 75% of the total VRAM that the 9070 XT has. But it will be actually clocked slightly slower, meaning that it'll be only 18 Gbits per second, making it about a third lower than the 9070 XT as opposed to just a quarter lower like it is in the rest of the specs. But having a GPU that is roughly 25% lower in specs than the 9070 XT could be worth it. Especially because one of the videos that we're going to be releasing probably on Monday based on our editing schedule, we were able to unlock the RX970 and turn it into a 9070 XT. And the performance that you get out of that is the best that I have ever seen from a BIOS tweak like this where you it can match a 9070 XT even though it has fewer cores. it only has 56 compute units whereas the 970 XT has 64, but that doesn't really appear to matter. And maybe the 9070 GRE could potentially get some treatment like that. Maybe there's a BIOS situation where you put the 9070 BIOS on it and it gets even faster. But obviously price point, not quite sure what that's going to look like. This thing's supposed to cost $5.49. There's been reports that the 9060 XT is supposed to cost $450. like that puts the 9070 GRE in like a $500 price point, which I'm not necessarily sure AMD can actually hit. We'll have to see what it looks like, but the details on the 970 GRE look to be good, at least specwise. The only real big uh hiccup with it versus the 7900 GRE is that the 7900 GRE had 16 GB of VRAM as opposed to 12, which is what we're allegedly getting on the 9070 GRE. Part of that is because the GRE 7900 was a cut down version of a GPU that started at 24, whereas the X-T only has 16. So, they can't really like drop it down a little bit. I don't think it's personally going to matter all that much in terms of performance. I think you're going to be more core limited than you're going to be VRAMm limited on this GPU, but hopefully the price point makes more sense than what we have from team right now. Let's see if you guys made sense over in the comments. We got Robloxxian saying, ""So basically the B580, 9070 XT, and 5090 are the only worth it GPUs for their price range and performance range. No surprise that the flagship always gets the most attention, but it's basically now the only one you can even consider at this point."" I'm just going to disagree on a couple things here. The B580, I think, absolutely a worthwhile GPU. You can get it very close to MSRP right now. Intel is crushing it there very silently. Nobody's really talking about the 9070 XT. Again, based on that video that that's supposed to be coming out on Monday, the 9070 is actually incredibly worth it if you're willing to tinker with it. It's crazy. I'm so excited to release this video. The the the numbers we got out of the 9070 is insane where it makes it so that it's a more sensible GPU for enthusiasts because if you're willing to tinker, you're going to be able to push this thing uh past what you think is possible. I I do agree the 9070 XT is worth it, but the 9070 shouldn't be slept on right now. But don't forget, you can also get a 9070 XT by going watch our UFD music live stream over on YouTube. 5090 I also, you know, is that a worth it GPU? That's just in a completely different class. Those things are costing 4 grand right now. I don't know about that. If you had to ask me what is the most worthwhile Nvidia GPU right now, I think it's the 5060 Ti 60 gig. I think that's the I think that's the most worthwhile one. Even though I mean if you could get it at the PNY MSRP that should be fine. Other than that it's really it's really tricky. I I don't think the 5090 is all that worth it. I think the 5080 is also very much a struggle. And then Okcomich saying at least Americans are seeing them at 420 and 550. Our retailers are asking 500 for 8 GB and 600 for 16 GB. And aside they want to be EVG is charging 650 for the gaming X. 680 for the Vanguard. Over here 5070 is cheaper somehow. Okay, that's weird. Uh, I just want to point out for something when it comes to comparing to American prices, we do not include tax, whereas very much of the rest of the world includes tax in their prices. So, like I did a video recently on how I've already pre-ordered the Switch 2 because uh you're able to do that in South Africa and my total out the door price was $723, but that includes 15% sales tax. And so my effective price was less than that and likely kind of be going to be close to what allegedly the Switch 2 is going to cost after the tariffs hit. But I mean $550 after a 15% tax rate puts you at $632. Even just at a 7% tax rate like we have here in the state of Pennsylvania, we're at 5.88. You're very close to 600 bucks. I'm not saying that's not bad. I'm just saying that like comparing American prices, you have to remember we're crazy and we don't include our taxes in the prices. You have to find that out after the fact in a very statebyst state. It's it's wild. And then Andra saying there was never any chance for the 96D XT reaching 5070 performance. That's the performance level where the RX970 nonXT is. I hear you. Um and I saw some other comments of me people accusing me of being crazy for expecting that the AMD card has to provide higher value in order for it to be worth purchasing. I'm not saying I believe that. I'm saying that's what the market data has shown. Unless AMD can provide that much value, people don't actually switch to them. The 9070 XT appears to provide that much value. You can get close to between 5070 Ti and 5080 level performance out of a card that's significantly cheaper. It looks like the 9060 XT isn't going to be able to hit that same value mark that the 9070 XT is at. So, the market likely will not go along with it. However, that doesn't mean it's not going to be a better bang forbuck GP. It just looks like it's potentially going to struggle a little bit more than the 970 XT. And then Ame talking about the ad that we had in yesterday's episode of Hot News saying, ""Older than Radioactive by Imagine Dragons."" Well, I feel old now. I used to listen to that song as a kid and I just realized how long ago that was. Yeah, that song old. That song real old. Also, uh this is one of the things that we love doing in our shorts. We love referring to 2020 and 2019 as half a decade or over half a decade ago. That bothers people a lot. I like to make you feel old. I like you to know that time just keeps on marching on and so it does here in my present of filming continues. So, I'm gonna stop hang I'm gonna go do other things. I'll see you back here for more of the hottest tech news on Tuesday. Uh tomorrow we should have our review of the Ino3 dropping on the channel. So, in case you want to get subscribed and watch that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ssMQtKAMyA,yuffie seesup you see okay yeah what the heck is this okay this is bad and no no don't read it all I'm gonna I'm gonna read it out too because it starts bad and then gets hilariously bad okay yuffie a sub brand of charger slash Battery Giant anchor has been caught sending pictures to their Cloud servers without user consent oh to which you might say yeah surprise surprise but wait there's more Paul Moore a security consultant was reviewing the yuffie doorbell duel a camera equipped smart doorbell that claims that recorded footage will be kept private and stored locally with military-grade encryption what does that mean that means AES 256. okay as far as I can tell nice but upon some snooping it turned out that yuffie was sending user data to the cloud including full resolution images from the camera despite claiming in their marketing materials that the files are stored locally and there's no Cloud integration oh oh there's a link we can actually check their website now ready have they updated no clouds or costs whoopsie daisies no cost because you're the product anyway sorry um the files are not only uploaded to the cloud but also tagged with facial recognition that ties the images that ties the images to a user whoa okay it also takes a snapshot of the feed before a face was recognized and uploads that to the cloud as well and it's not like Mr Moore is just making things up you know going on Mr Moore's story time to make yuffie look bad other users have tested the same thing and found that the files were uploaded even when they had never used the web UI wow but wait it gets even better you might think that Mr Moore might have reached out to yuffie and been ignored yeah not so he reached out and they replied saying that they were aware the photos were being uploaded and that it was for notification purposes no and that the pictures were deleted afterward oh they also said that they plan to encrypt the API messages no way you plan on doing this meaning well no no this is I'm sure they do because that will make it harder for users to detect that their images are being I said that well no they didn't say the quiet part out loud okay but they said that they will be encrypting the API messages further testing by Paul showed that this wasn't the case as after he deleted his pictures and notifications from the app he was still able to access the images hosted online um oh no another user discovered that you can remotely start a stream and watch the unencrypted live camera feeds without authentication using VLC this is this is junk we used to do when I was in high school you can if you can remotely start a stream and watch their cameras live no authentication no encryption oh hey hey what's up Paul hey I actually didn't know that we were specific that was Paul I believe so on Twitter um well great work Paul yeah yeah great work indeed um this is a massive massive this is disgusting not just user data you know mishandling Scandal this is a legal problem um apparently yuffie did initially deny to Paul M what was going on um there's another thing in here where he deleted his ER yeah which I thought he said yeah yeah yeah uh oh so that's next oh wait he deleted his account altogether never mind just deleting yeah so he deleted the pictures first oh no off his Local app or whatever and then later uh he found out that after deleting his account he could still access his photos wow so their whole like we're we're getting rid of these we're recycling these things he was also able to access the aes128 that's slightly less military grade encryption yeah the key in plain text by looking at the API calls neat so to recap it appears that yuffie is storing images of faces with usernames attached to them on public-facing servers without encryption they expose their own encryption keys and their API calls and allow users to access unencrypted streams without Authentication our discussion question compared to previous breaches how bad is it bad yeah well it depends which breach you're talking about because we've had like there's the Australian breach where everyone's like passports leaked out um but then there's been leaks breeches that aren't as bad so I yeah I don't know it's really bad though um how do we stop companies from being so uh um by suing them in ways that are actually meaningful yeah like not just cost of doing business fines like when something this bad happens you actually it needs to turn into Oblivion one of the biggest everyone else is afraid you make an example out of them we've talked about this on One show actually a bunch one of the biggest problems with tech lawsuits is it's often unimpactful amounts of money that they have to pay well it's not just that it's unimpactful it's that it takes so long to reach a verdict and with all the appeals and all the legal processes that you have to go through in order to actually reach the point where they pay a fine that the amount that they have probably made on that bad behavior during that time dwarfs the cost of the fine it's not even it's just not matter it's not even just how much of a percentage of their overall Revenue it is it's on a per illegal action basis that we're telling them it's worth it go for it yeah absolutely uh Cassandra asked are you guys going to continue working with anchor over this absolutely not you heard it here first we're done with anchor and that sucks because I really liked anchor yeah I've liked a lot of their products over the years that blows that is absolutely what we should be doing but it just sucks yeah yeah um if yuffie smart scale is sending pictures of my balls and taint okay is that a bad thing um sorry is that one of our discussions that's a discussion question yeah um I started reading that before I uh is I have this okay who wrote this topic this is the discussion question completely unaltered okay I have a yuffie smart scale is sending pictures of my balls and taint to the Chinese government that's what's written on the dock Justice is I should have read the whole thing before I started actually reading it out loud is this one of those situations where they went on a walk with their cousins um uh wow um I don't know if the smart scale has a camera pointed up I probably doubt it I know I think it does what I I think so I thought it did hold on well let's look it up this is talking about like a smart doorbell not a scale hold on maybe it has a camera but I I don't know I don't know maybe it does maybe it does visceral fat like maybe it like looks at your your tummy four sensors I don't know Luke I'm guessing ah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah in the shower you need to spend more time scrubbing your nether regions I mean that's a notification some people can use this notification brought to you by the the UV smart scan check on what's going out front going on outside your friend's Doors by checking out our our unencrypted door cam I mean it might have a camera just because oh yeah they're doing all kinds of things they didn't say they were doing yeah there you go it's not like a little tiny pinhole camera costs anything pretty much it could easily have one yeah they you know even 1080p wouldn't be that expensive yeah that was a creepy one right yeah we figured so so I have that Robot vacuum thing now and my girlfriend was showing me this super cool new feature of how you can call it and you can see out the front and you can talk through it and stuff and she was like oh yeah I think it's I think it's cool I think it's just so like people can like talk to their pets and stuff and I'm like this is horrifying I hate this we're taping over this it's not happening not cool and a big problem there's no reason why my my admittedly quite awesome and very happy with it yeah Robot vacuum needs a camera that is accessible through like the internet and stuff um so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nEAPffLTn8,Maya twirled in front of her mirror adjusting the Hem of her vibrant yellow dress her reflection radiated confidence tight curls framing her face like a crown Maya had always envisioned herself as a beauty queen not for the title but for the opportunity to redefine what beauty could mean her room was a collage of inspiration photos of diverse models handwritten affirmations and cutouts of bold designs she hoped to one day wear on a grand stage for Maya Beauty wasn't just about appearances it was about confidence self-expression and breaking barriers she had spent her teenage years advocating for these ideals whether through her small but growing social media following or by standing up for others in her school who were made to feel invisible now she was ready to take her message to a bigger stage the prestigious Crescent City beauty pageant the pageant was a Hallmark event in their City known for launching the careers of many influential figures in the beauty and fashion Industries Maya had spent months perfecting her application choosing photos that showcased her Unique Style and writing an essay that celebrated individuality and diversity in Beauty as she clicked submit on the application her heart fluttered with anticipation Maya imagined herself on stage not just competing but making a statement beauty comes in all forms and every person deserves to feel seen and celebrated next stop the crown she whispered smiling days turned into weeks and Maya's excitement grew with each passing moment when the email from the Crescent City beauty pageant finally arrived she opened it with Trembling Hands brimming with hope but as her eyes scanned the message her heart sank dear Maya thank you for your application unfortunately we regret to inform you the rejection hit her like a gust of wind snatching away her breath the reason cited were vague claims about limited spots and the need for alignment with Traditional Values Maya couldn't shake the nagging suspicion that the true reason lay beneath the surface her mother who had been cheering her on from the start noticed the change in Maya's demeanor that evening what happened sweetheart she asked gently they said no Maya replied her voice quivering but it doesn't feel right I feel like I wasn't what they were looking for not because of my talent or my message but because of me her mother wrapped her in a comforting hug but Maya's mind raced she had always known that beauty pageants had their biases but experiencing it firsthand left her stunned for a moment doubt crept in was she wrong to think she could challenge the norm but as the night wore on that doubt turned into determination be don't get to decide my worth she thought her fists clenching Maya resolved to find a way to make her voice heard whether she was rejected or not Maya sat cross-legged on her bed her laptop open and her phone in hand she hesitated for a moment before hitting recorded hey everyone she began her voice steady despite the knot in her stomach I want to talk about something personal she recounted her experience with the pageant carefully choosing her words to convey both her disappointment and her Hope for Change I applied because I believe beauty is about confidence and self-expression Maya said her eyes Earnest but it feels like they're holding on to outdated ideas of what beauty should look like Maya didn't just vent her frustrations she called for Action encouraging her followers to share their own stories of feeling excluded or overlooked because they didn't fit conventional standards let's show the world that beauty isn't about fitting into a mold she concluded as she uploaded the video her friends rallied around her you're brief for doing this her best friend Alana said people need to hear it Maya exhaled deeply her heart pounding she wasn't sure what to expect but she knew one thing her story deserved to be told Maya woke up the next morning to a flurry of notifications her phone buzzed incessantly as likes comments and shares poured in by mid day her video had amassed thousands of views people from all walks of life resonated with her story sharing their own experiences and praising her courage celebrities and influencers began to amplify Maya's message one prominent actress retweeted the video writing this is the kind of change we need thank you Maya for speaking up social media exploded with hashtags like Beauty forall and Stan with Maya turning her personal story into into a nationwide conversation Maya's parents watched in awe as their daughter's bravery inspired so many you've started something big her father said Pride evident in his voice despite the overwhelming support there were critics too some dismissed her as seeking attention While others clung to traditional Notions of beauty but Maya refused to let negativity deter her she responded thoughtfully reiterating her belief that beauty was in inclusive and deeply personal as the D's went on the discussion grew louder and the Crescent City beauty pageant found itself at the center of a storm Maya had become more than a rejected applicant she was now a symbol of resilience and change amid the growing backlash the Crescent City Beauty pageant's main sponsor a prominent Cosmetics brand known for its inclusive campaigns reached out to Maya the email was concise but Earnest requesting a meeting to discuss an exciting opportunity sitting across from the brands marketing team Maya felt a mix of nerves and excitement your story has inspired us one of the executives began we believe in the message you're spreading and we'd like you to be the face of our next campaign Maya's eyes widened in disbelief you want me to model for you not just model the executive clarified we want you to represent what beauty truly means confidence individuality and resilience we see you as a symbol of change and we'd be honored to have you lead this campaign tears welled up in Maya's eyes as she nodded I'd love to the offer wasn't just a personal Victory it was a chance to amplify her message on an even larger platform the photo shoot for the campaign was unlike anything Maya had ever experienced this set was vibrant affecting her personality and the creative team encouraged her to embrace her individuality as she posed in bold outfits and natural makeup Maya felt an overwhelming sense of belonging when the campaign launched it was met with widespread Acclaim Billboards commercials and social media posts featured Maya's radiant smile alongside the tagline Beauty Without Limits her story was shared alongside the campaign further cementing her as a role model for young people everywhere Maya's face became synonymous with the movement for inclusivity and Beauty interviews and speaking engagements followed giving her more opportunities to advocate for change her journey had

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9utWGl9zbPE,hi guys welcome back to our channel welcome back to everything wedding thank you guys so much for clicking on today's video and like we've always said we are happy to have you here if you're watching and you're not yet subscribed you might want to consider subscribing to the channel it's totally free you can also give this video a thumbs up as that helps to grow the channel hit that notification bell so that you're notified each time we upload a new video and leave me a comment in the comment section let me know which gown on this video is your favorite at the right time gave you my heart broke into pieces you fixed it again but i wonder so in today's video as we get to enjoy these beautiful stunning gowns we're going to be talking about you know when you're having a park wedding we're going to be giving you details to consider when you're planning your park wedding [Music] you were the one i needed if you're the outdoorsy type take a fresh approach to your wedding and get married in a park because nothing beats natural setting and plenty of sunshine plus the cost is tempting most permits and location fees are on the extra affordable side and many of the park turn out to be free outdoor wedding venues however if you're not prepared for the possible pitfalls bad weather annoying insects your dream day can play out like an outward bonded adventure broken scars you were there for me gave you my heart it was a part you were the one i needed love like this is really hard to find guess i [Music] so guys to help you plan a snapple free wedding in a park we're going to be giving you some good advice plus some pretty decor ideas you were the one i needed be hard to find so the first thing you need to do if you're planning a park wedding is the location so before settling on a ceremony site visit it several times during same season day of the week and time of the day as you plan to marry take note of pedestrian traffic and the position of the sun this will help you determine where you place your fishient your bridal party and guest for example you don't want people squinting in into late afternoon rays so try to anticipate potential problems beforehand like restrooms facilities and ample parking found in the dark broken you were there for me gave you my heart [Music] so once you've determined the perfect place contact the park administrative office and find out if weddings are allowed there after you get an okay ask about regulations and whether uh you have to reserve the site you'll most likely need a permit which is usually issued by your local parks department it will state if you're allowed to bring in chairs and toilets play music and have guests throw bad seed and read the fine print to see if there's a cleanup stipulation many parks charge fines for garbage left behind [Music] families are usually issued for free of charge but you probably have to pay a small location fee national parks charge anywhere between $50 and $200 [Music] she got time and she knows what you also need to consider religious affiliations some members of the clergy will only perform wedding ceremony within a house of worship so before you book that special spot by the lake make sure your officient is willing to work on location while many protestants and jewish couples are free to tie the knot outdoors roman catholics are encouraged to marry inside a church but each of the nation's dasises which are run by bishops has its own rules [Music] everything she got she got from my world [Music] you also need to consider the weather if mother nature is having a bad day it may translate into a rain socked ceremony site so it pays to always have a plan b the safest strategy is to secure a permit that will allow you to use an existing gazebo or band shell if one is close at hand and although tents aren't usually used for ceremony you might consider renting one for the day check with the park officials beforehand about regulations but just be prepared to pay for it regardless of the [Music] weather another contingency plan is to hold your ceremony at the home of a friend or relative who lives close to your original location that way guests won't have to scramble with alternative transportation routes the day of the wedding and print the addresses or a phone number to call uh that morning on a raid card on a rain card and include it in your invitation so that guests know exactly where to go and remember that no matter what the skies decide to throw your way a little humor and a big umbrella will help to save the day [Music] you also need to consider the dress since most park weddings take place during daylight hours a bride shouldn't look like they are attending the oscars save the glitter and bidding for a nighttime celebration as it looks out of place before dark instead you can opt for a simple and chic like a silk sleeve dress or something light and a thrill instead of a heavy or grand uh dress everything she got so just as evening wear is a fashion for par for the daytime bride tuxedos are a taboo for a groom if yours will be a formal affair they need to wear a stroller or morning coat with stripped pants a four ain hand tie completes the look and keeping things casual you have them choose a dark suit paired with a dress shirt and a tie the important thing to keep in mind is that the formality of their outfit should match the formality of your dress [Music] so guys i just want to thank you so much for watching today's video we'll be able to continue on our next video so make sure that you're subscribed and also hit the notification bell so that you will be notified when we upload the next video and also give this video a thumbs

company is she kind of like there was a problem and she found a way to solve it so i think that's always like a great um strategy when you're starting a business right absolutely i mean i think it's so important in today's um age just because we you know we are using products on our skin all the time right and as you're kind of learning about her items that goes right into your into your body and then not even that it goes into all of our water systems and everything so we're going to give her a second to get the tech handle but we're very excited because it looks like annette has joined us who's on the screen from one of our other amazing small businesses hi annette hi thanks for having me yes thank you so much for coming like with perfect skin we also need to think about exfoliating our lips and growing our lashes yeah thrilled to speak with our next sponsor lip service the founder annette will be joining us and we can pick her brain about some of the top products such as the lash elixir and the lip scrub and plump which i have right here so this is sorry my ring light is so bright but this is our vegan lash growth elixir so you can actually brush it onto your lashes or your brows and it helps to promote hair growth um it's completely all natural plant-based and vegan i even like to brush it's a little mascara wand so i even sometimes brush a little bit in my hair to keep my ways down but also i pull my hair back a lot and so it's actually helped um regrow some of my little baby hairs up at the front um so that's our you girl girl lash gross elixir when's the best time to put this on like so i have i use one of those lash elixirs i'll definitely have to try yours now that i know about it support women and local businesses so i definitely need to try yours but what is the best time to put it on is it in the morning is it before you go to bed like what would you recommend so i personally love to put it on before bedtime and i love to when i'm applying it to my lashes i actually apply it this way like when my eyes are closed not like you would a mascara because the idea is you want it to hit your lash line um you can also use it with extensions if you use it with a eyeliner brush as well however that being said i do have a lot of customers who love putting it on in the morning right before their mascara because they swear that it makes their mascara apply even easier so really it's an incredibly versatile product that you can use pretty much any time of day it's amazing i feel like especially us ladies like you need something for the growth i did lash for years and afterwards they were damaged so i'm like okay i need i need an elixir and i also noticed on your website chelsea and i were chatting about this before how we were like so obsessed with the vegan lip plumper i was like please tell me just about that so our lip plumper is made with completely all natural ingredients it's cinnamon ginger cayenne and so it just makes the blood flow to your lips naturally giving it a nice little plump and it's in a sweet almond oil base so it applies and actually restores moisture back to your lips it's not going to make your lips sticky um and it's just it's gorgeous the plump lasts about 30 to 45 minutes depending on you or your body type and it's a great layering piece to put underneath or over top of lipstick or lip gloss and is it this a color or is it a clear product it is a clear product but we do have so i'm actually wearing it right now it's our rosy raspberry lip gloss um so there it's just a very nice subtle hint of tint um and so i love to pair this with our lip plumper how do you want to start these this line of products i'm like i'm always so curious to find out what the little story is like did you just start mixing products together or did you find you had a need for for one of these yeah so um in my former job i became a certified aromatherapist and i loved you know kind of experimenting and making body care products for myself because when you go and look at ingredient lists you know they're really long and complicated and don't get me wrong there's a time and a place for science but um i was like why does it have to be so complicated and so i started making these lip products as gifts to give away to friends and family and everyone's like man these are amazing why aren't you doing this for your job you seem to clearly love it and so i my first three months in business i never even had a website i was just on etsy and that it just kind of took off from there so yeah i feel like a lot of the makers who either do soaps or body care they do they're just making it for their friends another lady who we're gonna have on later has a similar story so i find that that's so interesting it's like yeah just take your your passion and roll with it i mean you've been making some incredible products and chelsea mentioned you're going to talk to us about the lip scrub which is another one that we're like we all need especially going into spring exactly so this is um we have three flavors currently right now we have vanilla bean lemon drop and this is our most popular it's our caffeine fix so it's a coffee um lip scrub um what i love about this is we've actually partnered with so we're based out of niagara and we've based with another local company called moya shea butter so she's also based out of niagara all of her raw ingredients are certified organic leaving bunny certified and community fair trade so we use her beautiful grade a it's super ultra creamy shea butter in here um with an organic fair trade uh golden sugar as well and the coffee is also fair trade so those are the kinds of things we really look for when we partner with our um you know ingredient suppliers and packaging suppliers um so basically you just apply it to your lips in a little circular motion and you can either lick it off or towel it off and i love putting it on before bed so that shade can really soak into your lips overnight very cool that's how how to do it like how to yeah let's get a little messy it might get a little weird but hey let's do this uh so we provide you with a little stir stick you can use your finger if you'd like but the stir sticks a little nicer but i'm gonna use my finger for all and purposes right now you do not need a very large amount at all it's just like a little pea size and you basically just i love that like humming like i like a little emotion and you just you know kind of exfoliate it in there for a good like minute or two yeah and then literally lick it off oh my gosh if that grosses you out you can tell it off that's amazing i love that so with your products being so fresh like what is the shelf life of them do they like how long do they last for that's a great question so a lot of the products that we um have formulated have oils or some sort of base that will help it sustain um so we say on average like a year or two as long as they're stored in a cool dark place and you're keeping your fingers out of the product because bacteria um creates mold and you don't want that so that's why we give you the stir stick perfect yeah
